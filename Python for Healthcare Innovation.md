- **Sessions:**  
  1. Introduction to Python: Variables, data types, and user input  
  2. Basic operations: Arithmetic, conditionals, and output formatting  
  3. Project build: Coding and testing a BMI calculator  
- **Project:** Build a BMI Calculator (input height/weight, output BMI and category: underweight, normal, etc.)  
- **Relevance:** Teaches core coding skills with immediate medical application.  
- **Resources:**  
  - W3Schools Python Tutorial (w3schools.com/python)  
  - “Python Basics” by Real Python (realpython.com)  
  - Video: “Python for Beginners” by Tech With Tim (YouTube)  
  - Book: "Learn Python3 the hardway by Zed A . SHAWN"

##### Week 2: Managing Healthcare Data with Python
- **Objective:** Learn to handle and process multiple data points, simulating patient records.  
- **Sessions:**  
  1. Lists and loops: Storing and iterating over data  
  2. Basic file handling: Reading/writing data (e.g., CSV files)  
  3. Project build: Patient list manager with summary stats  
- **Project:** Patient List Manager (input patient names and vitals—e.g., pulse, temp—output average values)  
- **Relevance:** Mirrors real-world data management in healthcare settings.  
- **Resources:**  
  - Codecademy Free Python Course (codecademy.com/learn/learn-python-3)  
  - “Python Lists” by Corey Schafer (YouTube)  
  - pandas Documentation (pandas.pydata.org/docs/getting_started)  

##### Week 3: Analyzing Healthcare Data
- **Objective:** Use functions and libraries to analyze medical data and draw insights.  
- **Sessions:**  
  1. Functions: Reusable code for calculations  
  2. Conditionals and logic: Flagging abnormal values  
  3. Project build: Vitals analyzer with pandas intro  
- **Project:** Vitals Analyzer (input patient vitals, flag abnormals—e.g., high BP—and show basic stats)  
- **Relevance:** Introduces data analysis skills critical for evidence-based practice.  
- **Resources:**  
  - “Python Functions” by Programming with Mosh (YouTube)  
  - pandas Quick Start (pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/10min.html)  
  - “Python Crash Course” by Eric Matthes (Ch. 1–5, free excerpts online)  

##### Week 4: Showcasing Skills with Web Integration
- **Objective:** Present Python projects via a simple webpage using HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap.  
- **Sessions:**  
  1. HTML basics: Structure and content  
  2. CSS and Bootstrap: Styling and layout  
  3. Project build: Webpage displaying Week 3’s vitals analyzer output  
- **Project:** Web Dashboard (convert vitals analyzer into a static webpage with inputs/results)  
- **Relevance:** Enhances professional presentation skills and introduces web tools.  
- **Resources:**  
  - FreeCodeCamp HTML/CSS Tutorial (freecodecamp.org/learn)  
  - Bootstrap Getting Started (getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/getting-started)  
  - Video: “HTML & CSS Crash Course” by Traversy Media (YouTube)  
- **Further Readings & Next Steps:**  
  - *“Data Analysis with Python”* by Wes McKinney (pandas creator) – Intro chapters  
  - Matplotlib Tutorial (matplotlib.org/stable/tutorials) – For visualizing data  
  - “Introduction to Machine Learning with Python” (scikit-learn.org/stable/tutorial) – Basic ML concepts  
  - **What’s Next:** Explore intermediate Python (e.g., matplotlib for charts, scikit-learn for simple ML predictions like disease risk), or deepen web skills with Flask to connect Python to dynamic sites.
