>Imagine if Doc Brown from **Back to the Future** had Obsidian to help him manage all his brilliant ideas and inventions! Just like Marty McFly who needed to travel back in time to 1955 to prevent **Biff** from obtaining the almanac ([[Obsidian Guide]]) to alter his future timeline. 
>
> Obsidian helps you connect your [[thoughts]] and [[ideas]], creating a powerful network of knowledge that grows over time. And just like the DeLorean required plutonium to power its time-traveling capabilities, Obsidian is fuelled by your own *creativity* and *curiosity*, allowing you to journey through time and your ideas to unlock their full potential.

>[!quote]- Fall in Love with Systems not Goals - CLICK ME
>[[Obsidian Guide|There are four problems with Goals]].
>1) Winners and losers have the same goals
>2) Achieving a goal is only a momentary change
>3) Goals Restrict your Happiness
>4) Goals are at odds with long-term progress
>  
>  None of this is to say that goals are useless. Goals are good for _planning_ your progress and systems are good for actually _making_ progress.
>  
>- Goals can provide direction and even push you forward in the short-term, but eventually a well-designed system will always win. Having a system is what matters. Committing to the process is what makes the difference.
