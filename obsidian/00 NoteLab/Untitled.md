### 1. Introduction: Why Is Genetic Information So Important?

All the information required in a cell to survive and produce replicas that succeed itself is found in the genome1. Genetic information is important because it stores, processes, and transmits biological data from generation to generation2. Every organism’s biological information encoded in their genome is known as genetic information3. This biological information broadly categorizes how we breathe, our phenotype, how we react to adverse conditions, and how we metabolize4. The genetic code possesses this biological information in a long biopolymer located on specialized structures known as chromosomes5. In eukaryotic cells, this genetic information is located in the nucleus, where the nuclear membrane protects it from degradation6.

### 2. Introduction to Genetics

Genetics is the study of heredity7. Gregor Mendel, an Austrian Biologist, is considered the father of genetics, and his work helped us understand the concept of inheritance8. Genetics explores the transmission of biological properties from parents to offspring9. It also explores the expression and variation of these traits, their structure and functions, and how these materials change10. The unit of hereditary is the gene11. A gene is an entity that specifies the structure of a single polypeptide12. Genes are linked together in a sequence to form a particular protein13. Genetic information is stored as a sequence of bases in DNA14. A gene is the basic unit of heredity passed from parent to child15. Genes are sequences of DNA arranged, one after another, at specific locations on the chromosomes in the nucleus of cells16. They contain information for making specific proteins that lead to the expression of a particular physical characteristic or trait, such as hair color or eye color, or to a particular function in a cell17.

### 3. Storage of Genetic Information: Chromosomes

Genetic information, also known as the genome, is heritable biological information18. It is organized and stored in the chromosome19. Chromosomes are thread-like structures present in the nucleus of all cells20. A chromosome is an organized structure of DNA and protein21. It is a single piece of coiled DNA containing many genes, regulatory elements, and other nucleotide sequences22. Chromosomes also contain DNA-bound proteins, which serve to package the DNA and control its functions23. Chromosomes were first discovered by Strasburger in 181524.

#### 3.1. Structure of a Chromosome

A chromosome generally has eight parts: centromere (primary constriction or kinetochore), chromatids, chromatin, secondary constriction, telomere, chromomere, chromonema, and matrix25252525.

- **Centromere or Kinetochore**: This is the primary constriction at the center to which the chromatids or spindle fibers are attached26. Its function is to enable movement of the chromosome during the anaphase stage of cell division27.
    
- **Chromatid**: During cell division, a chromosome is divided into two identical half strands joined by a centromere28. Each half of a chromosome is a chromatid29. Each chromatid contains DNA and separates at Anaphase to form a separate chromosome30. Both chromatids are attached to each other by the centromere31.
    
- **Chromatin**: This is a complex of DNA and proteins that forms chromosomes within the nucleus of eukaryotic cells3232. Nuclear DNA is highly condensed and wrapped around nuclear proteins to fit inside the nucleus; it is not present as free linear strands33. Chromatin consists of DNA, RNA, and protein34.
    
- **Secondary Constriction**: This is generally present for nucleolar organization35.
    
- **Telomere**: This is the terminal region at each end of the chromosome36. A chromosome has two telomeres37.
    
- **Chromonema**: This is a threadlike coiled filamentous structure along which chromomeres are arranged38. Chromonema controls the size of the chromosome and acts as a site of gene bearing39.
    
- **Chromomeres**: These are bead-like structures present on threads or chromonema40404040. They are arranged in a row along the length of chromonema41.
    
- **Matrix**: Pellicle is the membrane surrounding each chromosome, and matrix is the jelly-like substance present inside the pellicle42424242. It is formed of non-genetic materials43.
    

The number of chromosomes is constant and is responsible for carrying the genes during cell division to the next generation44.

#### 3.2. Types of Chromosomes

There are two main and basic types of chromosomes: autosomes and sex chromosomes45.

- **Autosomes**: In humans, there are 22 pairs of autosomes46. Autosomes regulate the inheritance of all traits except sex-linked traits47.
    
- **Sex chromosomes**: In humans, there is only one pair of sex chromosomes, and they control sex-linked traits48. In total, there are 23 pairs of chromosomes, giving a total of 46 per cell49.
    

Chromosomes can also be categorized into four types according to the position of the centromere50. The centromere is the constricted region of a chromosome and plays a key role in DNA replication51.

- **Metacentric chromosomes**: The centromere is present in the middle of the chromosome, dividing it into two equal arms52.
    
- **Telocentric chromosomes**: They have centromeres present at the end of the chromosome, but are not observed in humans53.
    
- **Acrocentric chromosomes**: The centromere is present near the end of chromosomes54.
    
- **Submetacentric chromosomes**: The centromere is present near the middle and divides the chromosome into two unequal arms55.
    

Chromosomes vary extensively between different organisms56. They are an essential unit for cellular division and must be replicated, divided, and passed successfully to daughter cells to ensure genetic diversity and progeny survival57.

### 4. Prokaryotic Chromosome

In prokaryotes, a chromosome is typically circular and smaller58. It is contained in the cytoplasm, held with some protein in an area called the nucleoid59. Prokaryotic cells have no nucleus; their chromosome is dispersed within the cell and is not enclosed by a separate membrane60. Prokaryotes are monoploid, and the two ends of the DNA are covalently sealed to form a closed circle, which contains two unbroken complementary strands6161. These covalently closed circles are twisted into supercoils by basic proteins like histones62. Histone-like proteins appear to help organize bacterial DNA into a coiled chromatin structure called a nucleosome63. The nucleoid-associated proteins include HU protein, IHF, protein H1, Fir A, H-NS, and Fis64. However, the protein-associated DNA and nucleosome-like structures are detected in a variety of bacteria65. All bacteria, such as _E. coli_, have this kind of chromosome66. For example, _E. coli_'s DNA consists of a single closed-circular DNA molecule of length 4.6 million base pairs6767. Prokaryotes' DNA consists of 50–100 domains or loops and is negatively supercoiled68. Its ends are constrained by binding to a structure that consists of proteins attached to part of the cell membrane69. Supercoiling is essential for efficient replication and transcription of prokaryotic DNA70.

There is also an extra circle of DNA in prokaryotes called a plasmid71. Plasmids contain genes that give protection from anti-infection agents (antibiotic resistance), digestion of common supplements, and other extraordinary capacities72. Plasmids reproduce autonomously of the main chromosome, and many can be readily transferred between prokaryotic cells73.

### 5. Eukaryotic Chromosome

Eukaryotic chromosomes are found in the cell’s nucleus74. The principal feature distinguishing a eukaryotic cell from a prokaryotic cell is the presence of a membrane-bound nucleus75. This nucleus is the “control center” of the cell that stores all the cell’s genetic information, or DNA76. The nuclear membrane, or nuclear envelope, contains channels called pores that regulate the movement of molecules in and out of the nucleus77. The DNA inside the nucleus is organized into chromosomes78. At the most basic level, a chromosome is a molecule of DNA that is tightly coiled around proteins called histones7979. Eukaryotic cells have multiple chromosomes that are linear in shape80. In addition, human cells have many hundreds of copies of the mitochondrial genome81. In eukaryotic cells, the DNA is organized in the chromosome using a complex packing strategy to fit inside the nucleus8282.

### 6. Nucleosome

DNA is wrapped around proteins known as histones to form structures called nucleosomes83. Nucleosome is a structural unit of a eukaryotic chromosome, consisting of a length of DNA coiled around a core of Histones8484. A nucleosome is the basic repeating subunit of chromatin packaged inside the cell’s nucleus85. Nucleosomes are also the packing unit of DNA built from histones proteins around which DNA is coiled8686. The histones are small and basic proteins rich in amino acids such as lysine and/or arginine87. There are five histone proteins found in eukaryotic cells: H1, H2A, H2B, H3, and H488. The histones form an octamer of eight histone proteins attached together to form nucleosomes8989. Thus, a nucleosome is an octamer or eight histone proteins complex with DNA90.

Two copies each of the histone proteins H2A, H2B, H3, and H4 form a histone core9191. About 200 base pairs of DNA are wrapped around this protein complex, forming a nucleosome9292. The last histone, H1, seals off the DNA as it enters and leaves the nucleosome, adding stability to the structure93. This nucleosome is linked to the next one with the help of a linker DNA94. H1 is associated with the linker region and helps the folding of DNA into a complex structure called chromatin95. A nucleosome consists of a cylindrical-shaped histone octamer and a stretch of DNA wrapped around the Histones complex approximately 1.65 times9696. Nucleosomes are wrapped into 30nm fibers that form tightly packed Chromatin97. In humans, about six feet of DNA must be packed into a nucleus with a diameter less than a human hair, and nucleosomes play a key role in that process98.

#### 6.1. Structure of a Nucleosome

The structure of a nucleosome consists of a segment of DNA wound around eight Histones proteins and resembles thread wrapped around a spool99. The nucleosome is composed of DNA and four core Histones: H2A, H2B, H3, and H4100. The DNA wrapped **around** the Histone complex is generally inaccessible to DNA binding proteins101.

#### 6.2. Functions of Nucleosome

Nucleosomes serve as a scaffold for the formation of higher-order chromatin structure102. They also serve as a layer for the regulatory control of gene expression103. It not only serves as a general gene repressor but also as a repressor of all transcription (genic, intragenic, and intergenic)104. The core nucleosome performs a fundamental regulatory role apart from the Histone “tails,” which modulate gene activity105. In addition to DNA packaging, nucleosome organization plays a crucial role in controlling DNA accessibility of many DNA binding proteins to regulatory elements on the chromosomes106.

#### 6.3. Nucleosome Assembly

Replication-coupled nucleosome assembly is the process by which newly synthesized DNA is assembled into nucleosomes immediately following DNA replication using both parental and newly synthesized histones107. The nucleosome assembly reaction has two steps108:

1. In the first step, Histones H3 and H4 are deposited onto DNA as an H3/H4 tetramer to form a nucleosome precursor109. Chromatin assembly factor 1 (CAF-1) mediates this first step110.
    
2. In the second step, the nucleosome is completed by the association of two H2A/H2B dimers with this precursor111. This second step can take place in the absence of CAF-1 or DNA replication112.
    

### 7. Chromatin

Chromatin refers to a mixture of DNA and proteins that form the chromosomes found in the cells of humans and other higher organisms113. Chromatin makes it possible for a number of cell processes to occur, including DNA replication, transcription, DNA repair, genetic recombination, and cell division114. More specifically, chromatin refers to a complex of nucleic acid (i.e., DNA) and histone proteins115115. The Histone proteins are DNA binding proteins116116. They are made up of four subunits, which are repeated twice to produce eight subunits of histone proteins, referred to as Octamers117. Hence, the chromatin is made of DNA wrapped around octamers (DNA wrapped around Histone proteins)118. In Eukaryotes, chromatin helps to organize the DNA because the DNA contains a lot of genetic information119. This ‘organization of the DNA’ is achieved by the coiling of the DNA around the histone proteins120. The structure of the chromatin is an uncondensed form121. Through the process of cell division, the chromatin condenses to form the chromosome122.

#### 7.1. Chromatin Remodeling

In eukaryotes, DNA is tightly wound with histone proteins into a complex called chromatin123. Through the process of chromatin remodeling, this complex can be "opened" so that specific genes are expressed—through the process of transcription (forms mRNA)124. Hence, for transcription to occur, chromatin remodeling has to happen125.

The histone proteins carry a specific charge when interacting with the DNA126. Histone proteins are positively charged due to the presence of the lysine amino acid127. DNA is negatively charged due to the presence of a phosphate group128.

To achieve transcription, the DNA needs to be detached from the Histone proteins so that RNA polymerase and other factors can enter, find a promoter region, bind to it, and start transcribing129. To do this, the positive charge of the histone protein (due to lysine) needs to be eliminated130. This is done with the enzyme HISTONE ACETYL TRANSFERASE (HAT), which adds an acetyl group to the histone protein, causing the positive charge to be eliminated131. Now the histone protein has a neutral charge132. As a result of the histone protein having a neutral charge, its affinity for the DNA will decrease133. This results in the DNA being unpackaged/released from the histone protein134. The unpackaged DNA is now ready to undergo transcription135.

To reverse the process and repackage the DNA with the histone proteins, an enzyme called HISTONE DEACETYLASES (HDACs) is employed to reassign the positive charge to the histone protein136.

#### 7.2. Types of Chromatin

There are two forms of chromatin: Euchromatin and Heterochromatin137.

- **Euchromatin**: This is less condensed and can be transcribed138. It is usually active in terms of transcription and replication139. It is loose to allow RNA and DNA polymerases to transcribe and replicate DNA, respectively140.
    
- **Heterochromatin**: This is highly condensed and cannot typically be transcribed141. Heterochromatin is further classified as **constitutive heterochromatin** and **facultative heterochromatin**142.
    
    - **Constitutive heterochromatin**: This is the DNA sequence existing in all cells of an organism143. It is related to highly repeated DNA144.
        
    - **Facultative heterochromatin**: This is not present in all cells145. For instance, the gene encoding beta-globin in animals is present in certain cells but not in blood cells146.
