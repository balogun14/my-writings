### 1. Introduction: Why Is Genetic Information So Important?

All the information required in a cell to survive and produce replicas that succeed itself is found in the genome. Genetic information is important because it stores, processes, and transmits biological data from generation to generation. Every organism’s biological information encoded in their genome is known as genetic information. This biological information broadly categorizes how we breathe, our phenotype, how we react to adverse conditions, and how we metabolize. The genetic code possesses this biological information in a long biopolymer located on specialized structures known as chromosomes. In eukaryotic cells, this genetic information is located in the nucleus, where the nuclear membrane protects it from degradation.

### 2. Introduction to Genetics

Genetics is the study of heredity. Gregor Mendel, an Austrian Biologist, is considered the father of genetics, and his work helped us understand the concept of inheritance. Genetics explores the transmission of biological properties from parents to offspring. It also explores the expression and variation of these traits, their structure and functions, and how these materials change. The unit of hereditary is the gene. A gene is an entity that specifies the structure of a single polypeptide. Genes are linked together in a sequence to form a particular protein. Genetic information is stored as a sequence of bases in DNA. A gene is the basic unit of heredity passed from parent to child. Genes are sequences of DNA arranged, one after another, at specific locations on the chromosomes in the nucleus of cells. They contain information for making specific proteins that lead to the expression of a particular physical characteristic or trait, such as hair color or eye color, or to a particular function in a cell.

### 3. Storage of Genetic Information: Chromosomes

Genetic information, also known as the genome, is heritable biological information. It is organized and stored in the chromosome. Chromosomes are thread-like structures present in the nucleus of all cells. A chromosome is an organized structure of DNA and protein. It is a single piece of coiled DNA containing many genes, regulatory elements, and other nucleotide sequences. Chromosomes also contain DNA-bound proteins, which serve to package the DNA and control its functions. Chromosomes were first discovered by Strasburger in 1815.

#### 3.1. Structure of a Chromosome

A chromosome generally has eight parts: centromere (primary constriction or kinetochore), chromatids, chromatin, secondary constriction, telomere, chromomere, chromonema, and matrix.

- **Centromere or Kinetochore**: This is the primary constriction at the center to which the chromatids or spindle fibers are attached. Its function is to enable movement of the chromosome during the anaphase stage of cell division.
- **Chromatid**: During cell division, a chromosome is divided into two identical half strands joined by a centromere. Each half of a chromosome is a chromatid. Each chromatid contains DNA and separates at Anaphase to form a separate chromosome. Both chromatids are attached to each other by the centromere.
- **Chromatin**: This is a complex of DNA and proteins that forms chromosomes within the nucleus of eukaryotic cells. Nuclear DNA is highly condensed and wrapped around nuclear proteins to fit inside the nucleus; it is not present as free linear strands. Chromatin consists of DNA, RNA, and protein.
- **Secondary Constriction**: This is generally present for nucleolar organization.
- **Telomere**: This is the terminal region at each end of the chromosome. A chromosome has two telomeres.
- **Chromonema**: This is a threadlike coiled filamentous structure along which chromomeres are arranged. Chromonema controls the size of the chromosome and acts as a site of gene bearing.
- **Chromomeres**: These are bead-like structures present on threads or chromonema. They are arranged in a row along the length of chromonema.
- **Matrix**: Pellicle is the membrane surrounding each chromosome, and matrix is the jelly-like substance present inside the pellicle. It is formed of non-genetic materials.

The number of chromosomes is constant and is responsible for carrying the genes during cell division to the next generation.

#### 3.2. Types of Chromosomes

There are two main and basic types of chromosomes: autosomes and sex chromosomes.

- **Autosomes**: In humans, there are 22 pairs of autosomes. Autosomes regulate the inheritance of all traits except sex-linked traits.
- **Sex chromosomes**: In humans, there is only one pair of sex chromosomes, and they control sex-linked traits. In total, there are 23 pairs of chromosomes, giving a total of 46 per cell.

Chromosomes can also be categorized into four types according to the position of the centromere. The centromere is the constricted region of a chromosome and plays a key role in DNA replication.

- **Metacentric chromosomes**: The centromere is present in the middle of the chromosome, dividing it into two equal arms.
- **Telocentric chromosomes**: They have centromeres present at the end of the chromosome, but are not observed in humans.
- **Acrocentric chromosomes**: The centromere is present near the end of chromosomes.
- **Submetacentric chromosomes**: The centromere is present near the middle and divides the chromosome into two unequal arms.

Chromosomes vary extensively between different organisms. They are an essential unit for cellular division and must be replicated, divided, and passed successfully to daughter cells to ensure genetic diversity and progeny survival.

### 4. Prokaryotic Chromosome

In prokaryotes, a chromosome is typically circular and smaller. It is contained in the cytoplasm, held with some protein in an area called the nucleoid. Prokaryotic cells have no nucleus; their chromosome is dispersed within the cell and is not enclosed by a separate membrane. Prokaryotes are monoploid, and the two ends of the DNA are covalently sealed to form a closed circle, which contains two unbroken complementary strands. These covalently closed circles are twisted into supercoils by basic proteins like histones. Histone-like proteins appear to help organize bacterial DNA into a coiled chromatin structure called a nucleosome. The nucleoid-associated proteins include HU protein, IHF, protein H1, Fir A, H-NS, and Fis. However, the protein-associated DNA and nucleosome-like structures are detected in a variety of bacteria. All bacteria, such as _E. coli_, have this kind of chromosome. For example, _E. coli_'s DNA consists of a single closed-circular DNA molecule of length 4.6 million base pairs. Prokaryotes' DNA consists of 50–100 domains or loops and is negatively supercoiled. Its ends are constrained by binding to a structure that consists of proteins attached to part of the cell membrane. Supercoiling is essential for efficient replication and transcription of prokaryotic DNA.

There is also an extra circle of DNA in prokaryotes called a plasmid. Plasmids contain genes that give protection from anti-infection agents (antibiotic resistance), digestion of common supplements, and other extraordinary capacities. Plasmids reproduce autonomously of the main chromosome, and many can be readily transferred between prokaryotic cells.

### 5. Eukaryotic Chromosome

Eukaryotic chromosomes are found in the cell’s nucleus. The principal feature distinguishing a eukaryotic cell from a prokaryotic cell is the presence of a membrane-bound nucleus. This nucleus is the “control center” of the cell that stores all the cell’s genetic information, or DNA. The nuclear membrane, or nuclear envelope, contains channels called pores that regulate the movement of molecules in and out of the nucleus. The DNA inside the nucleus is organized into chromosomes. At the most basic level, a chromosome is a molecule of DNA that is tightly coiled around proteins called histones. Eukaryotic cells have multiple chromosomes that are linear in shape. In addition, human cells have many hundreds of copies of the mitochondrial genome. In eukaryotic cells, the DNA is organized in the chromosome using a complex packing strategy to fit inside the nucleus.

### 6. Nucleosome

DNA is wrapped around proteins known as histones to form structures called nucleosomes. Nucleosome is a structural unit of a eukaryotic chromosome, consisting of a length of DNA coiled around a core of Histones. A nucleosome is the basic repeating subunit of chromatin packaged inside the cell’s nucleus. Nucleosomes are also the packing unit of DNA built from histones proteins around which DNA is coiled. The histones are small and basic proteins rich in amino acids such as lysine and/or arginine. There are five histone proteins found in eukaryotic cells: H1, H2A, H2B, H3, and H4. The histones form an octamer of eight histone proteins attached together to form nucleosomes. Thus, a nucleosome is an octamer or eight histone proteins complex with DNA.

Two copies each of the histone proteins H2A, H2B, H3, and H4 form a histone core. About 200 base pairs of DNA are wrapped around this protein complex, forming a nucleosome. The last histone, H1, seals off the DNA as it enters and leaves the nucleosome, adding stability to the structure. This nucleosome is linked to the next one with the help of a linker DNA. H1 is associated with the linker region and helps the folding of DNA into a complex structure called chromatin. A nucleosome consists of a cylindrical-shaped histone octamer and a stretch of DNA wrapped around the Histones complex approximately 1.65 times. Nucleosomes are wrapped into 30nm fibers that form tightly packed Chromatin. In humans, about six feet of DNA must be packed into a nucleus with a diameter less than a human hair, and nucleosomes play a key role in that process.

#### 6.1. Structure of a Nucleosome

The structure of a nucleosome consists of a segment of DNA wound around eight Histones proteins and resembles thread wrapped around a spool. The nucleosome is composed of DNA and four core Histones: H2A, H2B, H3, and H4. The DNA wrapped around the Histone complex is generally inaccessible to DNA binding proteins.

#### 6.2. Functions of Nucleosome

Nucleosomes serve as a scaffold for the formation of higher-order chromatin structure. They also serve as a layer for the regulatory control of gene expression. It not only serves as a general gene repressor but also as a repressor of all transcription (genic, intragenic, and intergenic). The core nucleosome performs a fundamental regulatory role apart from the Histone “tails,” which modulate gene activity. In addition to DNA packaging, nucleosome organization plays a crucial role in controlling DNA accessibility of many DNA binding proteins to regulatory elements on the chromosomes.

#### 6.3. Nucleosome Assembly

Replication-coupled nucleosome assembly is the process by which newly synthesized DNA is assembled into nucleosomes immediately following DNA replication using both parental and newly synthesized histones. The nucleosome assembly reaction has two steps:

1. In the first step, Histones H3 and H4 are deposited onto DNA as an H3/H4 tetramer to form a nucleosome precursor. Chromatin assembly factor 1 (CAF-1) mediates this first step.
2. In the second step, the nucleosome is completed by the association of two H2A/H2B dimers with this precursor. This second step can take place in the absence of CAF-1 or DNA replication.

### 7. Chromatin

Chromatin refers to a mixture of DNA and proteins that form the chromosomes found in the cells of humans and other higher organisms. Chromatin makes it possible for a number of cell processes to occur, including DNA replication, transcription, DNA repair, genetic recombination, and cell division. More specifically, chromatin refers to a complex of nucleic acid (i.e., DNA) and histone proteins. The Histone proteins are DNA binding proteins. They are made up of four subunits, which are repeated twice to produce eight subunits of histone proteins, referred to as Octamers. Hence, the chromatin is made of DNA wrapped around octamers (DNA wrapped around Histone proteins). In Eukaryotes, chromatin helps to organize the DNA because the DNA contains a lot of genetic information. This ‘organization of the DNA’ is achieved by the coiling of the DNA around the histone proteins. The structure of the chromatin is an uncondensed form. Through the process of cell division, the chromatin condenses to form the chromosome.

#### 7.1. Chromatin Remodeling

In eukaryotes, DNA is tightly wound with histone proteins into a complex called chromatin. Through the process of chromatin remodeling, this complex can be "opened" so that specific genes are expressed—through the process of transcription (forms mRNA). Hence, for transcription to occur, chromatin remodeling has to happen.

The histone proteins carry a specific charge when interacting with the DNA. Histone proteins are positively charged due to the presence of the lysine amino acid. DNA is negatively charged due to the presence of a phosphate group.

To achieve transcription, the DNA needs to be detached from the Histone proteins so that RNA polymerase and other factors can enter, find a promoter region, bind to it, and start transcribing. To do this, the positive charge of the histone protein (due to lysine) needs to be eliminated. This is done with the enzyme HISTONE ACETYL TRANSFERASE (HAT), which adds an acetyl group to the histone protein, causing the positive charge to be eliminated. Now the histone protein has a neutral charge. As a result of the histone protein having a neutral charge, its affinity for the DNA will decrease. This results in the DNA being unpackaged/released from the histone protein. The unpackaged DNA is now ready to undergo transcription.

To reverse the process and repackage the DNA with the histone proteins, an enzyme called HISTONE DEACETYLASES (HDACs) is employed to reassign the positive charge to the histone protein.

#### 7.2. Types of Chromatin

There are two forms of chromatin: Euchromatin and Heterochromatin.

- **Euchromatin**: This is less condensed and can be transcribed. It is usually active in terms of transcription and replication. It is loose to allow RNA and DNA polymerases to transcribe and replicate DNA, respectively.
- **Heterochromatin**: This is highly condensed and cannot typically be transcribed. Heterochromatin is further classified as **constitutive heterochromatin** and **facultative heterochromatin**.
    - **Constitutive heterochromatin**: This is the DNA sequence existing in all cells of an organism. It is related to highly repeated DNA.
    - **Facultative heterochromatin**: This is not present in all cells. For instance, the gene encoding beta-globin in animals is present in certain cells but not in blood cells.
