- **Numeric Types:**
    
    - `int`: Represents whole numbers (e.g., 3, -10, 0).
    - `float`: Represents decimal numbers (e.g., 3.14, -2.5, 0.0).
    - `complex`: Represents complex numbers (e.g., 1 + 2j, 3 - 4j).
    
- **Sequence Types:**
    
    - `str`: Represents text as a array of characters (e.g., "hello", 'world').
    - `list`: Represents an ordered, mutable sequence of items, which can be of different types (e.g., \[1, "hello", 3.14]).
    - `tuple`: Represents an ordered, immutable sequence of items (e.g., (1, "hello", 3.14)).
    - `range`: Represents a sequence of numbers, often used for looping (e.g., range(10) generates numbers from 0 to 9).
    
- **Mapping Type:**
    
    - `dict`: Represents a collection of key-value pairs, where keys are unique and immutable (e.g., {"name": "Alice", "age": 30}).
    
- **Set Types:**
    
    - `set`: Represents an unordered collection of unique items (e.g., {1, 2, 3}).
    - `frozenset`: Represents an immutable version of a set.
    
- **Boolean Type:**
    
    - `bool`: Represents truth values, either `True` or `False`.
    
- **Binary Types:**
    
    - `bytes`: Represents immutable sequences of bytes.
