# ✅ Week 1: Foundations of Programming with Python

## 🎯 Objective
Introduce basic programming concepts and apply them to a simple healthcare tool.

---

## 🗓️ Day 1: Introduction to Python

### 🔹 Goals
- Understand Python syntax
- Learn about variables and data types
- Handle user input and display output

### 🔍 Topics to Cover
- What is Python and why use it in healthcare?
- Setting up Python (IDLE or VS Code)
- Variables (`str`, `int`, `float`, `bool`)
- `input()` and `print()` functions
- Type conversion (`int()`, `float()`, etc.)

### 📌 Checklist
- [x] Explain what Python is
- [x] Show how to install and run Python
- [x] Create simple variables with different data types
- [x] Take input from the user and display it
- [x] Practice small examples (e.g., take name & age as input and greet user)

### 📚 Resources
- [ ] W3Schools: Python Syntax and Variables
- [ ] Real Python: Python Data Types
- [ ] Tech With Tim video (first 20 mins)

## 🗓️ Day 2: Basic Operations and Logic

### 🔹 Goals
- Perform arithmetic calculations
- Use conditionals (`if`, `elif`, `else`)
- Format output for clarity

### 🔍 Topics to Cover
- Arithmetic operators (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `**`, `%`)
- Comparison operators (`==`, `!=`, `>`, `<`)
- Logical operators (`and`, `or`, `not`)
- `if` statements for decision-making
- Using `f-strings` for output formatting

### 📌 Checklist
- [x] Review arithmetic operations
- [x] Build basic logic with if-else
- [x] Create conditions based on input
- [x] Format output using `f""` strings
- [ ] Practice exercise (e.g., check if number is positive/negative)

### 📚 Resources
- [ ] W3Schools: Python Operators and Conditions
- [ ] Real Python: Python Conditionals
- [ ] Tech With Tim video (mid-section)

## 🗓️ Day 3: Build the BMI Calculator

### 🔹 Goals
- Apply learned concepts in a small project
- Write, test, and debug a BMI calculator
- Use medical logic to categorize BMI

### 🔍 Topics to Cover
- Collect height and weight using `input()`
- Calculate BMI = weight / (height * height)
- Use `if-elif` to determine BMI category
- Display results using `print()` with formatting

### 📌 Checklist
- [ ] Review height & weight input and type conversion
- [ ] Calculate BMI correctly (2 decimal places)
- [ ] Use logic to define categories:
  - BMI < 18.5 → Underweight
  - 18.5 ≤ BMI < 24.9 → Normal
  - 25 ≤ BMI < 29.9 → Overweight
  - BMI ≥ 30 → Obese
- [ ] Test with multiple inputs
- [ ] Explain use cases in medical settings

### 📚 Resources
- [ ] W3Schools: Python Functions (for optional modular approach)
- [ ] “Learn Python3 the Hard Way” (Project 5 - Variables & Printing)
- [ ] Final 10 minutes of Tech With Tim's beginner video

## 🧠 Project Outcome
By the end of the week, students should be able to:
- Write clean Python code
- Take user input, apply logic, and display output
- Understand how basic programming applies to health tech
