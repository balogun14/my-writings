  Integrated approval flows (Maker-Checker) across all modules, including endpoints for:
  - Create, Edit, View, Delete  
  - Request Approval  
  - Approve / Decline Actions

### 5. DevOps Support Across Projects

- **Value Credit**  
  Supported Mr. Lazarus in setting up and provisioning a staging environment on our Linux servers, compensating for the absence of a dedicated DevOps engineer.

- **NIBSS Project**  
  Provided interim DevOps support before the official DevOps hire, including environment configuration and deployment pipeline management.

- **DevOps Onboarding Support**  
  Helped onboard and guide the newly hired DevOps engineer by explaining existing infrastructure and deployment flows.

### 6. Training
	I completed the mandatory CyberSecurity Training for backend Engineers



## Challenges Overcome

- **VPN Access Delays**  
  Initial delays in VPN provisioning impacted access to certain bank environments. I adapted by focusing on offline code familiarization and reviewing documentation until access was granted.

- **Bank-Side Endpoint Issues**  
  Encountered non-responsive or failing endpoints on some banking environments. Resolved these through collaborative debugging with QA and DevOps teams.

- **Deep Codebase Onboarding**  
  The complexity of legacy codebases posed an initial challenge. I turned this into a strength by dedicating time to understanding business logic, architectural patterns, and third-party integrations.



Thank you for the opportunity.
