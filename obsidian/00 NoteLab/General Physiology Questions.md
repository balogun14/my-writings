**Options:**  
A. Heart and brain receives 250 mL/min and 750 mL/min respectively  
B. Kidneys, liver and splanchnic circulation receives 1,200 mL/min and 1,500 mL/min respectively  
C. Hypoxia increases coronary circulation by 300%  
D. Cushing reflex is stimulated by increased intracranial blood pressure in order to compensate for cerebral blood flow  
E. Options A to D are true  

**Answer:** E  
**Reason:** All are correct: A, B give accurate flow rates, C notes coronary response to hypoxia, D describes Cushing reflex, as per the document (Page 18-19).

**CVS 39. Which of the following vaso-cutaneous reflexes is not true?**  
**Options:**  
A. Warmth stimulation causes cutaneous vasoconstriction as painful stimulation to the skin causes axon reflex  
B. Light stroking in the skin causes white line owing to vasoconstriction  
C. Firmer stroking causes redline, flare and swelling owing to various release of histamine and arteriolar and capillary dilation  
D. Adenosine and lactic acid donâ€™t cause increased blood flow to an organ after a period of arterial occlusion  
E. Options A to D are correct  

**Answer:** A, D  
**Reason:** A: Warmth causes vasodilation, not vasoconstriction. D: Adenosine/lactic acid cause reactive hyperemia. B, C are correct (white line, triple reflex), as per the document (Page 20).

**CVS 40. Circulatory responses to exercise:**  
**Options:**  
A. Heart rate, cardiac output, arterial blood pressure increased to about 180 b/min, 30 L/min and 200 mm Hg respectively  
B. Accumulation of hypoxia, hypercapnia, lactic acid and adenosine cause vasodilatation to increase blood flow to the exercising muscles  
C. Increased cardiac output is due to increased venous return from increased muscle pump activity  
D. Increased systolic pressure and heart rate from psychic stimuli, increased sympathetic activity and increased cardiac output  
E. Options A to D are correct  

**Answer:** E  
**Reason:** All are correct: A gives exercise values, B describes vasodilation, C notes muscle pump, D explains pressure/HR increase, as per the document (Page 21).

**CVS 41. Circulatory responses to haemorrhage include:**  
**Options:** Same as CVS 2  
**Answer:** E  
**Reason:** Same as CVS 2.

**CVS 42. Concerning hypertension:**  
**Options:**  
A. Arterial blood pressure greater than 150/95 mm Hg can develop cardiac and renal failure even stroke  
B. Primary hypertension may be related to sodium, atherosclerosis, hyperlipidaemia/dyslipidaemia, angiotensin, testosterone, stress and endothelium sodium-ion channels  
C. Secondary hypertension is associated to Cushingâ€™s syndrome, phaeochromocytoma, atherosclerosis, renal artery stenosis. Vitamin C, magnesium, L-Arginine, may help as adjunct to antihypertensive drug  
D. Regular exercise and selective diets may help  
E. All of the above are correct  

**Answer:** E  
**Reason:** All are correct: A defines hypertension complications, B lists primary causes, C notes secondary causes and adjuncts, D confirms lifestyle benefits, as per the document (Page 22).

**CVS 43. Cardiac failure:**  
**Options:** Same as CVS 6  
**Answer:** B, C, D  
**Reason:** Same as CVS 6.
