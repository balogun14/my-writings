# ✅ Week 2: Managing Healthcare Data with Python

## 🎯 Objective
Learn to handle and process multiple data points, simulating patient records.

---

## 🗓️ Day 1: Lists and Loops

### 🔹 Goals
- Store multiple patient records using lists
- Use loops to iterate through data
- Understand basic list methods

### 🔍 Topics to Cover
- Lists: creating, indexing, slicing
- `for` loops and `while` loops
- Nesting data (list of lists or dictionaries)
- Basic list methods: `.append()`, `.remove()`, `.len()`

### 📌 Checklist
- [ ] Introduce patient data structure (name, temp, pulse)
- [ ] Create a list of patient records
- [ ] Loop through patient list to print each patient's vitals
- [ ] Add a new patient to the list
- [ ] Calculate and print average temperature/pulse using loop

### 📚 Resources
- [ ] Codecademy: Python Lists & Loops
- [ ] Corey Schafer’s YouTube video on Lists
- [ ] Real Python: Loops and Iterables (optional)

## 🗓️ Day 2: Basic File Handling (CSV)

### 🔹 Goals
- Read/write patient data to/from files
- Use `.csv` files to simulate EHR-like record keeping
- Understand file I/O best practices

### 🔍 Topics to Cover
- `open()`, `read()`, `write()`, `with` statement
- Writing patient records to `.csv` file
- Reading data from `.csv` file and parsing it
- Use `split()` and `strip()` for basic processing

### 📌 Checklist
- [ ] Explain CSV format and its use in healthcare
- [ ] Write patient data (name, temp, pulse) to a CSV
- [ ] Read patient data back and reconstruct into lists
- [ ] Calculate summary stats (e.g., average pulse)
- [ ] Discuss safe file handling (`with` block, file closing)

### 📚 Resources
- [ ] Codecademy: File Handling in Python
- [ ] pandas Documentation (intro sections)
- [ ] W3Schools: Python File Handling

## 🗓️ Day 3: Project – Patient List Manager

### 🔹 Goals
- Combine lists, loops, and file I/O
- Create a mini patient management system
- Display data summary for medical decisions

### 🔍 Project Plan
- Input: Patient name, pulse, temperature
- Process:
  - Store in list or CSV
  - Update and read records
  - Calculate average pulse and temperature
- Output: Print summary and patient report

### 📌 Checklist
- [ ] Collect and store at least 3 patient entries
- [ ] Save to and load from file (`.csv`)
- [ ] Loop through data to print readable report
- [ ] Show average pulse and temperature
- [ ] Wrap logic in functions (if students are ready)

### 📚 Resources
- [ ] pandas Docs (optional for advanced summary)
- [ ] Corey Schafer’s CSV Handling video (optional)
- [ ] “Learn Python3 the Hard Way” exercises on files

## 🧠 Project Outcome
By the end of the week, students should be able to:
- Manage small-scale patient data using Python
- Use lists and file I/O to simulate real EHR systems
- Generate useful healthcare metrics from raw input
