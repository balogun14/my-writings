### **Lesson Plan: Introduction to Fundamental Programming Concepts in C#**

**Duration: 2 Days**

---

## **Day 1: Core Data Structures and Problem-Solving**

### **Session 1: Simple Data Structures - Arrays and Lists (1 hour)**

- Introduction to arrays (fixed-size collections)
- Introduction to lists (dynamic collections)
- Basic operations: adding, removing, iterating
- **Mini Project:** Create a simple to-do list app using a `List<string>` where users can add, remove, and view tasks.

### **Session 2: Algorithms - Sorting and Searching (1.5 hours)**

- Understanding problem-solving through algorithms
- Common sorting algorithms (Bubble Sort, Selection Sort)
- Searching techniques (Linear Search, Binary Search)
- **Mini Exercise:** Implement Bubble Sort and Binary Search in C#

### **Session 3: Talking to Files - Reading and Writing (1 hour)**

- Understanding file handling in C#
- Writing to and reading from text files using `StreamWriter` and `StreamReader`
- **Mini Project:** Create a simple note-taking app that saves and loads notes from a file.

## **Day 2: Code Reusability, Text Manipulation, Error Handling, and OOP**

### **Session 4: Making Your Code Reusable - Methods and Functions (1 hour)**

- Defining and calling methods
- Function parameters and return values
- **Mini Exercise:** Convert previous sorting/search algorithms into reusable functions

### **Session 5: Playing with Text - Working with Strings and Characters (1 hour)**

- String manipulation techniques (concatenation, formatting, searching)
- Common string methods (`Substring`, `Split`, `Replace`, `ToUpper`, `ToLower`)
- **Mini Exercise:** Create a text formatter that takes a userâ€™s input and processes it (e.g., counting words, replacing words).

### **Session 6: Oops! Handling Errors - Exception Handling (30 min)**

- Using `try`, `catch`, `finally`
- Handling common exceptions (`FileNotFoundException`, `DivideByZeroException`)
- **Mini Exercise:** Modify the file-handling project to include error handling for missing files.

### **Session 7: Level Up Your Code - Introduction to OOP (1.5 hours)**

- Understanding classes and objects
- Properties and methods
- Creating and using instances
- **Final Project:** Build a basic **Student Management System**
    - Create a `Student` class with properties (`Name`, `Age`, `Grade`)
    - Store student records in a list
    - Add methods to add, update, and display student details
